# Asteroids

This is a simple implementation of the classic **Asteroids** video game built using Python. The game features a spaceship controlled by the player, which can shoot at and destroy asteroids while avoiding collisions.
## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need:

- Python 3.10+
- A unix-like shell (e.g., zsh or bash)

Additionally, make sure to install the required dependencies by setting up a virtual environment:

1. **Install Python 3.10+**
2. **Set up a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```
3. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
4. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Play

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Ensure your virtual environment is activated (as shown above).
4. Run the game by executing the following:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
5. Use `WASD` to move your spaceship and press the space bar to shoot. Avoid colliding with asteroids, and try to destroy as many as you can!
